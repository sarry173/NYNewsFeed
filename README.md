# NYNewsFeed
NY Times Most Popular Articles Project

This repository contains a sample app of The New York Times most popular articles that implements the MVVM architecture using Dagger2, Navigation, ViewModel, DataBinding, LiveData, Retrofit, RxJava. 

# Highlights

1. MVVM Architectural pattern.
2. Android Architecture components.
2. RxJava used for asynchronous request.
3. Dagger2 used for Dependancy Injection.
4. Espresso used for UI automation testing.
5. Gradle scripts for running sonarqube static code analysis, code coverage, etc.

The application has been build with using the latest architecture guidline provided by google for android.
It has been designed with the best coding practice, maintained loosly coupled code, repository pattern, asynchronous api call and using all the **Android Architecture components**.

The whole application is built based on the MVVM architectural pattern.
